# Karg

## What is this?

`Karg` is supposed to be a library for command line arguments, that works for both kotlin-native and kotlin-jvm.
My goal is to not use any code specific to only kotlin-native or kotlin-jvm.

## Why though?

It's just something i felt like trying, I'll still try to do everything in a serious manner, so this will actually be useful (I hope).

## How do i use this in my project?

## How do I build it myself?

## How do the unit tests work?
